# Frontend Career Path

- Create a separate email for career
    - ex: yourname.c@gmail.com
    - Use this only for job applications and no other services
    - resume
    - linkedin
    - job sites
    - This way, job email requests don’t get cluttered in other service emails
- Use NovoResume for resume pdf
    - Limit resume to a single page
    - Keep the bullet points short and to the point
    - Use Bold (Ctrl + B) to highlight key terms in bullet points
    - Keep the resume focused on one role (preferably frontend-only for freshers)
- Use VS Code as editor
    - Learn basic shortcuts if possible (search on youtube)
        - cut, copy paste, select words, move by words, select line, cut line, past line, copy line down
    - If computer is slow
        - Create GitHub Account (try to use a different email account other than career email account)
        - Create a repository
        - Open this with GitHub Codespaces
        - or
        - Create GitPod account (try to use a different email account other than career email account)
